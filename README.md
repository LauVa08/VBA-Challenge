# VBA-Challenge
two documents in here: Multy year stock volume and alphabetical testing
For this assignment, I used codes that I found from youtube videos, from class videos, and screenshots that other students had put on Slack. I googled "VBA cheatsheets" and use some. 
Also I checked the teacher comments of the picture he had commented on as to understand the problem of the student and the solution the teacher gave. Then I would try it. 
Based on those it gave me the idea of how to write them on VBA, as I struggle how to write them in the right order. 
For the Conditional Formatting, I googled the code, "code for conditional formating in VBA" and I went trough articles that work on mine. 
Same when I tried to removed the formate from 12 and to be on 11.
Then when it work on one, I copy and paste to the rest.
